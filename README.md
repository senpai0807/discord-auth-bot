# Discord Auth Bot For Your Applications ðŸŒ™
## How To Use
This bot is pretty much plug and play. Navigate to the config.json located in the Structures folder and input the following inputs listed.
After inputting everything, simply run `npm install or npm i`
Then run `npm start`

# Deployment
Note: You must input the following required inputs into the config.json located in the Structures folder or it will not execute.
```
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/senpai0807/discord-auth-bot.git

# Navigate to the project
cd discord-auth-bot

#Start the discord bot
npm start
```

# Road Of Development
I plan to make regular updates. The first update is removing the use ndeb and using mongoose/mongodb instead.
Another update I will make is removing the use of a sitebase and have the keys that are generated validated within local machine that the discord bot will be hosted at and also storing the generated keys into the mongodb database.

# Usage
I don't really care if you pull this git and make it your own. I made this specifically because I don't see many discord auth bots be open-sourced.
